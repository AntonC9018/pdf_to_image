# pdf_to_image

A python GUI that allows you to convert a pdf into images of each page.
Supports either extracting pages from a file or from a web pdf document (url).

It requires `poppler` to be installed and either added to path, or put in the same folder with the script. 
It has to be either built from the source code manually, or downloaded via a package manager (in my case, Chocolatey).
Other than that, the script has no external dependencies (it uses built-in modules).

It is pretty basic, but it works for my needs.
